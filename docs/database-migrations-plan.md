# Nexora Database Migrations Plan — M01–M21 (DRAFT)

> **Status (2026-08-13): DRAFT SQL committed and extended through Phase 7.4 Session 3; NOT applied to any database.**
>
> The migrations implement the ordering proposed by the 90-point master
> specification §5.25. They have been validated on an embedded real PostgreSQL
> engine, but **M02 is intentionally not final**: live Supabase introspection must
> happen first. Applying these files to any remote/local Supabase project needs a
> separate explicit go-ahead.

## Safety gate

`M02` is a fail-closed preflight, not a claim that the live schema is empty. It
performs no DDL and raises an exception if it finds known legacy Nexora objects
such as `salons`, `organizations`, `organization_members`, `job_salon_members`,
`staff`, `appointments`, or `referrals`. This prevents the later migrations from
silently creating a parallel `businesses` model.

The known live project already uses `salons`, `organization_members`, and
related ownership helpers. Therefore the checked-in M02 **must not be run there
as-is**. First inspect the live schema read-only, map every equivalent table,
column, constraint, policy, trigger, function, bucket, and relationship, and
then regenerate M02 with explicit data-preserving `ALTER`/rename/backfill steps.
No `DROP TABLE` or destructive replacement is allowed.

### Deliberate decisions

- `businesses` is the target canonical tenant root, but live `salons` must be
  mapped/reused by finalized M02; a parallel tenant table is forbidden.
- Money is integer paise. The fixed advance is `ceil(total_paise / 4)`, so
  ₹1,200 (`120000`) produces ₹300 (`30000`) advance and ₹900 (`90000`) due.
- Booking snapshots are immutable after insertion; catalog edits/archive do not
  rewrite history.
- Public rendering uses `get_public_website_by_slug()` rather than anonymous
  table reads. Private staff/access/payment fields are omitted from its payload.
- The database never stores Razorpay secrets. Signature verification occurs in
  trusted server/Edge code before the retry-safe `verify_payment()` transaction.
- `payment_refunds` remains deferred because the repository has no implemented
  refund backend. This follows P37 and avoids a fake/unusable refund surface.
- SQL cannot read browser `localStorage`. M15 creates DB draft/progress homes;
  the later app wiring step must upsert each signed-in owner's existing
  `nexora_onboarding_state` / `nexora_builder_state` payload once.
- Buckets are private. Public media reads require a published website and an
  allowed business-scoped display path; uploads/updates/deletes require tenant
  membership. No social-video bucket is created.
- M16 keeps global predefined suggestions separate from tenant-owned `services`;
  its composite `(category_id, theme_id)` FK blocks cross-theme category links.
  See [`phase-7.1-theme-service-database.md`](phase-7.1-theme-service-database.md).
- M17 extends the existing tenant-owned `services` table in place with nullable
  theme/category/predefined provenance. Composite FKs reject wrong-theme or
  wrong-category links without deleting or guessing links for custom services.
  See [`phase-7.2-saved-service-catalog-links.md`](phase-7.2-saved-service-catalog-links.md).
- M27 reuses the existing `social_videos`, `businesses`/`business_members` and
  `auth.users` relationships instead of a second video or identity model. It
  adds two nullable scoping columns (`theme_key`, `video_kind`) plus
  `social_video_likes`, where a composite `(video_id, business_id, theme_key)`
  FK makes cross-theme/cross-tenant likes structurally impossible and partial
  unique indexes make duplicate likes impossible. Anonymous likers reuse the
  existing `website_events.visitor_token` concept. The weekly ranking is
  derived from `businesses.timezone` on read — nothing is stored or scheduled.
  See [`phase-15.8-likes-weekly-most-liked.md`](phase-15.8-likes-weekly-most-liked.md).
- M18 is generated from `src/lib/themeServices.ts`; it upserts exactly five
  themes, 17 categories, 78 canonical predefined services, and 30 relational
  suggested mappings. See [`phase-7.3-five-theme-seed.md`](phase-7.3-five-theme-seed.md).
- M19 exposes one read-only RPC requiring `p_theme_id`; SQL returns only that
  active theme’s categories, predefined services, and `is_suggested=true` rows.
  See [`phase-7.4-session-1-database-ui-read.md`](phase-7.4-session-1-database-ui-read.md).
- M20 derives one manageable tenant from `auth.uid()` membership, validates the
  full theme/category/predefined chain, and enforces one saved row per
  `(business_id, predefined_service_id)`. See
  [`phase-7.4-session-2-service-saving.md`](phase-7.4-session-2-service-saving.md).
- M21 completes refresh persistence and mutable saved-service management while
  deriving tenant ownership server-side and never mutating the global catalog.
  See [`phase-7.4-session-3-final-integration.md`](phase-7.4-session-3-final-integration.md).

## Validation performed

Run:

```bash
npm run validate:migrations
```

The validator uses `@electric-sql/pglite` **0.3.16**, a real PostgreSQL engine
compiled to WebAssembly, including its `pgcrypto` and `btree_gist` extensions.
It creates only minimal Supabase-compatible `auth`/`storage` test fixtures.

Result on 2026-08-13:

- **21/21 migrations applied cleanly on an empty schema**
- **21/21 migrations applied cleanly a second time** (replay/idempotency)
- **19/19 functional tests passed**

| Test | Assertion |
|---|---|
| A | Owner A cannot read Business B through RLS |
| B | One service row feeds the published website and reflects edits |
| C | One staff row feeds assignments and public-safe output |
| D | Published output reflects normalized updates without republishing/copying |
| E | ₹1,200 → ₹300 fixed advance + ₹900 remaining |
| F | An unverified signature cannot confirm a booking |
| G | Repeated verified callbacks create one payment/activity and confirm once |
| H | Overview and revenue RPCs reflect the same booking/payment records |
| I | Archiving/editing a service preserves the booking snapshot |
| J | Progress + JSON draft preserve onboarding resume state |
| K | A published slug loads; a missing/draft slug does not |
| L | Anonymous payload excludes commission, access roles, permissions and payment internals |
| M | Theme/category/service FKs reject orphans and cross-theme links without changing business services |
| N | Client roles see only active catalog rows and cannot mutate the global catalog |
| O | Saved services preserve manual rows and require exact theme/category/predefined provenance |
| P | Five-theme seed exactly matches Phase 2–6 source data and remains duplicate-free |
| Q | Theme-scoped RPC returns only the requested theme’s categories/services/suggestions |
| R | Add Selected saves all five themes once with exact tenant/provenance and preserves duplicates/custom rows |
| S | Refresh, edit/deactivate/delete, switching, global safety, and cross-tenant isolation remain correct |

This validation proves draft consistency on a clean PostgreSQL schema. It does
**not** replace live-project introspection, Supabase-specific review, staging
application, or the complete post-apply acceptance run.

## Required live introspection (read-only)

Before changing M02, capture at minimum:

1. Server/PostgreSQL/Supabase migration versions and installed extensions.
2. `information_schema.columns` for every `public` table, including defaults and
   nullability.
3. Primary/foreign/unique/check/exclusion constraints and delete behaviors.
4. Existing indexes, triggers, functions (definitions, owner, volatility,
   `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`) and grants.
5. RLS enabled/forced flags and every `pg_policies` definition.
6. `auth.users` relationships and current ownership chain.
7. Storage buckets, object naming conventions and `storage.objects` policies.
8. Row counts, duplicate/nil values and orphan checks needed before adding
   uniqueness, `NOT NULL`, enum/check, FK, or overlap constraints.
9. Exact mapping from existing `salons`, `organization_members`, `services`,
   staff/appointment/referral concepts to the §5.1 canonical model.
10. Current app-facing RPC/view names that must remain compatible.

Store the sanitized introspection output outside Git if it contains customer or
security-sensitive data. Commit only the resulting schema decisions and safe
M02 SQL.

## Execution runbook (requires separate approval)

1. Complete and review live Supabase introspection.
2. Regenerate M02 and adapt later migrations wherever live object shapes differ.
3. Re-run `npm run validate:migrations`; add representative legacy-schema
   upgrade fixtures and verify data-preserving behavior.
4. Review the full diff, take a recoverable backup, and obtain explicit
   migration-execution approval.
5. Apply M01–M21 in order with Supabase CLI migrations (preferred) or carefully
   through the SQL editor; stop on the first error and do not skip migrations.
6. Run acceptance tests A–L from spec P88 plus Phase tests M–S against
   staging/live as approved, including multi-user RLS and browser/server flows.
7. Generate Supabase TypeScript types (`supabase gen types typescript`) per P72,
   commit them, and wire the service layer/screens to the single source of truth.

**Next step:** live Supabase introspection → regenerate M02 → approved M01–M21
application → P88 tests A–L + Phase tests M–S → P72 TypeScript types.
