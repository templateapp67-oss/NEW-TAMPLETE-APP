# AGENTS.md — Nexora Salon Website Builder

Guidance for AI agents and human contributors working in this repository.
Read this before making changes. For the current state and next steps, see
[`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md).

## Project overview

**Nexora** is an interactive wizard + live website builder for salons and beauty
professionals, with AI content generation and post-launch management modules.

The app contains:

- **16-step onboarding wizard** (`src/screens/Step*.tsx`, driven by `src/App.tsx`)
  — template, salon details, services, team, photos, socials, location, booking
  rules, publish.
- **Staff management module** (`src/components/StaffManagementModule.tsx`) —
  7-day schedules, payroll & commissions, role permissions, availability.
- **Post-launch dashboard (screens 18–25)** — tabs: overview, website,
  bookings, payments, share, settings, referral, branding
  (`src/components/PreviewPane.tsx` + dashboard tabs in `src/App.tsx`).
- **Salon Owner Dashboard (screen 26, Phase 17.1)** —
  `src/components/OwnerDashboard.tsx` over `src/lib/ownerDashboard.ts`:
  sections for Overview, Today's / Upcoming Appointments, Customers,
  Revenue/Payments, Calendar and Notifications, scoped to the signed-in
  owner's OWN salon. Today's Appointments (17.2) and Upcoming Appointments
  (17.3) are live, read-only over the existing booking records and sharing
  ONE row renderer (`OwnerAppointmentRow.tsx`); the other four sections are
  placeholders. It is a sibling
  module of the 18–25 dashboard, **not** a replacement — do not fork a
  second dashboard system.
- **Booking confirmation** (dashboard demo screen
  `src/components/BookingConfirmation.tsx`, booking ID `NX-10482`; the REAL
  public-site confirmation is `src/components/SiteBookingConfirmation.tsx`
  over `src/lib/siteBookingConfirmation.ts`), **Share Referral Premium**,
  **Branding White-label**.
- **Owner auth + shop location** — Supabase Auth, Leaflet map with Nominatim
  geocoding, and a **public nearby-salon search** at the `/nearby` route
  (`src/components/NearbySalonSearch.tsx`).

There is **no README**; `AGENTS.md` + `docs/HANDOFF.md` are the orientation docs.

## Architecture

### Server (`server.ts`)

- Express on port **3000**, bound to `0.0.0.0`. In dev it mounts the Vite dev
  middleware; in production (`NODE_ENV=production`) it serves `dist/` with an SPA
  fallback for client routes and JSON 404s for unknown `/api/*` paths.
- CORS is open (`*`) — required by the preview proxy
  (`https://{port}-{sandboxId}.e2b.app`).
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/health` → `{ status: 'ok', screens: 25, timestamp }`
  - `GET /api/geocode/search?q=...` — Nominatim forward geocoding
    (server-side proxy, rate-limited to ≥1.1s, cached 24h).
  - `GET /api/geocode/reverse?lat=...&lon=...` — Nominatim reverse geocoding.
  - `POST /api/generate-bio` — Gemini team-bio generation **with offline
    fallback** when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing or the API fails.
  - `POST /api/improve-text` — Gemini copy rewrite **with rule-based offline
    fallback** (tone/keyword aware).

### Client

- **No router.** `src/main.tsx` switches on the pathname: exactly `/nearby`
  renders `NearbySalonSearch` (public customer discovery), everything else
  renders `App`.
- `src/App.tsx` owns the wizard state machine (16 steps), the active module
  (`wizard | staff-management | dashboard`), and dashboard tabs. Progress and
  salon data persist to `localStorage` under key `nexora_onboarding_state`
  (`nexora_dashboard_tab` for the dashboard tab).
- `src/types.ts` holds the shared domain model (`SalonData`, `Service`,
  `TeamMember`, `WeeklySchedule`, …) and `initialData`.

### Data layer (`src/lib/`)

- `supabaseClient.ts` — browser client built from `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` +
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; **null when unconfigured** (callers must handle
  that; `requireSupabase()` throws a readable error). Never use a
  `service_role` key client-side.
- `useAuth.ts` — thin Supabase Auth wrapper (email/password session).
- `ownerUpcomingAppointments.ts` — FUTURE bookings (strictly after the
  salon-local day, cancelled/failed excluded) for the owner's own salon,
  nearest-first and grouped by date. Reuses the 17.2 projection and tenant
  resolution; never forks a second appointment model.
- `ownerTodayAppointments.ts` — today's bookings for the owner's own salon,
  projected from the EXISTING 10.7/16.5 payment records through 16.7's
  `readSalonBookings` (permission re-checked, tenant-keyed). "Today" is the
  salon-local day; statuses are the existing values only.
- `ownerDashboard.ts` — the owner dashboard's only data entry point:
  section registry + access model + `loadOwnerDashboardContext()`
  (session → `resolveOwnerSalonId()` → one read of that salon over existing
  columns). It takes **no** salon id from anywhere; unauthorized access
  returns no salon data at all. Read-only — 17.1 added no DB objects.
- `ownerSalon.ts` — resolves the salon owned by the signed-in user via the
  **existing** schema: `auth.users.id → organization_members (role='owner') →
  salons.organization_id`, using the DB helper `nexora_owner_salon_ids()` when
  exposed. Never hardcodes a salon id.
- `salonLocationService.ts` — owner location persistence. **Authoritative
  columns on `public.salons`: `address`, `latitude`, `longitude`,
  `location_confirmed`, `location_confirmed_at`.** (`location_latitude` /
  `location_longitude` do NOT exist — verified 42703.) Do not introduce a
  second parallel location system.
- `nearbySalons.ts` — public nearby search: reads only coordinate-bearing,
  confirmed salons, computes distance with a JS Haversine function (no
  PostGIS/RPC), and surfaces readable errors for missing grants/RLS.
- `location.ts` — shared coordinate helpers (`normalizeCoordinates`,
  `findNearbySalons`, radius logic).

### Docs

- `docs/nexora-database-spec.md` — the 90-point Nexora Supabase master
  specification and source for migration order §5.25.
- `docs/database-migrations-plan.md` + `supabase/migrations/` — **DRAFT** M01–M27.
  They pass clean replay x2 plus tests A–T in PGlite, but have **not been applied
  to any database**. M02 is deliberately a fail-closed preflight and must be
  regenerated after read-only live Supabase introspection. Never execute the
  migration set without a separate explicit go-ahead.
- `docs/owner-location-setup.sql` — earlier manual setup notes for owner
  location. Reconcile it with the finalized M02/RLS plan before any future SQL
  execution; the app itself never executes it.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | browser (Vite) | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | browser (Vite) | Supabase anon/public key |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | server | enables real Gemini bio/copy generation (fallback otherwise) |
| `NOMINATIM_APP_IDENTIFIER` | server (optional) | overrides built-in Nominatim User-Agent |
| `NOMINATIM_REFERER` | server (optional) | overrides built-in Nominatim Referer |
| `NOMINATIM_BASE_URL` | server (optional) | switch geocoding service |

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` (and/or `.env.local`, which `server.ts` also
loads). All `.env*` files are gitignored except `.env.example`.

## Conventions & guardrails

- **Frame-aware responsiveness**: themed website renderers draw inside a
  FIXED-WIDTH preview frame (desktop 950 / tablet 768 / mobile 390). Never size
  them with Tailwind viewport breakpoints (`md:` …) — those key off the real
  browser and match even inside the 390px phone frame. Use the renderer `mode`
  via `siteGrid()` / `heroModeValue()`.
- **Style**: Tailwind utility classes inline; follow the existing look of the
  screens; use `TopBar` for standardized headers; `motion` for transitions;
  `lucide-react` for icons. The `@` alias points at the repo root.
- **Navigation vs action semantics**: in-page navigation must be an `<a
  href="#section-...">` (focusable, visible target, open-in-new-tab); only
  real actions are `<button type="button">`. Resolve section ids through
  `siteSectionDomId()` / `heroTargetId()`, never hardcoded strings.
- **Validate owner-supplied media URLs.** Salon media is untrusted input:
  pass it through `isSafeMediaUrl()` / `safeMediaUrl()` before it reaches a
  `src`/`href`, and fall back to theme media when it fails. Never rely on
  React's `javascript:` guard as the only defence.
- **Owner-scoped surfaces must reuse `resolveOwnerSalonId()`.** Salon
  ownership is `auth.users → organization_members (role='owner') →
  salons.organization_id` and nothing else. `job_salon_members` is a
  staff relationship and must never be used for ownership. Never accept a
  salon id from a prop, URL, or localStorage.
- **Never invent business facts.** Customer-facing surfaces must not hardcode
  counts, ratings, years or volumes a salon did not supply. Derive them from
  real data (see `heroStat()`) and render nothing when there is no data.
- **Gemini features must keep their offline fallbacks** — the app must work
  without an API key.
- **Server-side secrets stay server-side** — `GEMINI_API_KEY` etc. must never
  reach the browser; Supabase uses only the anon key.
- **No destructive DB work** — no `DROP TABLE` and no database execution without
  explicit approval. Drafting/testing migration files locally is not permission
  to apply them. Live introspection and a regenerated M02 come first.
- **Preview compatibility**: the server must bind `0.0.0.0`, allow all hosts,
  and keep CORS open (`vite.config.ts` and `server.ts` already do this — do
  not regress it).
- **Don't touch `vite.config.ts` HMR/watch settings** — they are intentionally
  tuned for agent editing (`DISABLE_HMR` env).
- **Verification**: after UI/feature changes, run
  `node verify-22-screens.js` and `npm run lint`. After migration changes, also
  run `npm run validate:migrations` and keep the 27/27 x2 + 21/21 result.

## Git workflow

- Session work happens on the `arena/*` branch; open a PR against `main` and
  merge it (repo history uses merge commits, e.g. "Merge pull request #N from
  templateapp67-oss/arena/...").
- `docs/` changes are just as important as code — keep `HANDOFF.md` current at
  the end of every session.
